# HRMS AI Development Guide

## Project Context

This is a Human Resource Management System (HRMS).

Current Stack:

Backend:
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Security
- JWT Authentication
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Flyway
- OpenAPI / Swagger

Frontend:
- Angular
- TypeScript
- Angular Router
- Reactive Forms

Architecture:
- Feature-Based Modular Monolith

The objective is long-term maintainability, consistency, scalability, and security.

---

# AI Operating Rules

Before writing any code:

1. Search the codebase for existing implementations.
2. Reuse existing patterns.
3. Follow existing naming conventions.
4. Avoid introducing new frameworks.
5. Avoid duplicate functionality.
6. Preserve architecture consistency.
7. Generate production-ready code.
8. Generate secure code by default.
9. Generate maintainable code over clever code.
10. If multiple approaches exist, choose the simplest maintainable solution.

Never assume.

Always inspect related files before modifying code.

# Project Architecture

Every business module must follow:

feature
├── controller
├── service
├── repository
├── dto
│   ├── request
│   └── response
├── entity
├── mapper
├── exception
└── validator

Example:

employee
├── controller
├── service
├── repository
├── dto
├── entity
├── mapper
└── exception

leave
├── controller
├── service
├── repository
├── dto
├── entity
├── mapper
└── exception

attendance
├── controller
├── service
├── repository
├── dto
├── entity
├── mapper
└── exception

Do not create new global controller/service/repository packages.

New functionality belongs to the appropriate feature module.

# Backend Rules

## Controllers

Controllers must:

- Handle HTTP requests only
- Validate requests
- Call services
- Return DTOs
- Return proper HTTP status codes

Controllers must NOT:

- Access repositories directly
- Perform business logic
- Perform calculations
- Construct entities manually

Good:

Controller -> Service

Bad:

Controller -> Repository

---

## Services

Services must:

- Contain all business logic
- Handle transactions
- Coordinate repositories
- Enforce business rules

Services must NOT:

- Return JPA entities
- Handle HTTP concerns
- Contain presentation logic

---

## Repositories

Repositories must:

- Handle persistence only

Repositories must NOT:

- Contain business logic
- Perform authorization checks
- Perform DTO mapping

---

## DTO Rules

Every API endpoint must use DTOs.

Examples:

CreateEmployeeRequest

UpdateEmployeeRequest

EmployeeResponse

LeaveRequestResponse

Never expose entities through APIs.

Forbidden:

```java
return employee;
```

Required:

```java
return employeeMapper.toResponse(employee);
```

---

## Entity Rules

Entities represent database tables only.

Entities must not:

- Call services
- Perform authorization
- Contain complex business logic

Use:

```java
@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class AuditableEntity
```

All entities should inherit:

- createdAt
- updatedAt
- createdBy
- updatedBy
- active

---

## Exception Rules

Never throw:

```java
RuntimeException
Exception
```

Always create specific exceptions.

Examples:

```java
EmployeeNotFoundException
RoleNotFoundException
DuplicateEmployeeException
LeaveBalanceExceededException
```

Use:

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
```

for centralized exception handling.

---

## Validation Rules

Use Bean Validation.

Examples:

```java
@NotBlank
@NotNull
@Email
@Size
```

Validation belongs in DTOs.

Avoid manual validation whenever possible.

---

## Transaction Rules

Use:

```java
@Transactional
```

Only on service methods.

Never on:

- Controllers
- Repositories

---

## Logging Rules

Use:

```java
@Slf4j
```

Log:

- Authentication events
- Authorization failures
- Business events
- Errors

Never log:

- Passwords
- JWT tokens
- Secrets
- Sensitive employee information

---

# Security Rules

Authentication:

JWT

Authorization:

Role + Permission Based

Rules:

- No hardcoded permissions
- No hardcoded roles
- Permissions stored in database
- All protected endpoints require authorization

Example permissions:

EMPLOYEE_VIEW

EMPLOYEE_CREATE

EMPLOYEE_UPDATE

EMPLOYEE_DELETE

PAYROLL_VIEW

PAYROLL_GENERATE

LEAVE_APPROVE

---

# Database Rules

Database:

PostgreSQL

Migration Tool:

Flyway

Rules:

Every schema change requires migration.

Examples:

V1__initial_schema.sql

V2__employee_table.sql

V3__leave_table.sql

Never modify existing migrations.

Always create a new migration.

---

# API Design Rules

Base URL:

/api/v1

Examples:

/api/v1/employees

/api/v1/leave

/api/v1/payroll

/api/v1/attendance

/api/v1/auth

Use plural resources.

Use proper HTTP verbs.

GET

POST

PUT

PATCH

DELETE

Avoid verbs in URLs.

Bad:

/getEmployee

/createEmployee

Good:

GET /employees

POST /employees

---

# Mapper Rules

Use mappers for entity ↔ DTO conversion.

Examples:

EmployeeMapper

LeaveMapper

PayrollMapper

Controllers and services should not manually copy fields.

---

# Angular Rules

Folder Structure:

src/app

core
shared
features

Example:

features

├── auth
├── employee
├── leave
├── payroll
├── attendance
└── organization

---

## Angular Components

Components must:

- Have a single responsibility
- Be reusable
- Be small and focused

Prefer:

Standalone Components

OnPush Change Detection

Avoid:

Massive components

Business logic in templates

---

## Angular Services

All HTTP requests go through services.

Required:

Component
→ Service
→ Backend API

Forbidden:

Component
→ HttpClient

---

## Angular Forms

Use:

Reactive Forms

Do not use Template Driven Forms unless explicitly required.

---

## Angular State Management

Prefer:

Signals

RxJS

Introduce NgRx only when complexity requires it.

Do not introduce NgRx prematurely.

---

# Code Quality Rules

Priorities:

1. Correctness
2. Security
3. Maintainability
4. Readability
5. Performance

Never sacrifice maintainability for cleverness.

Prefer explicit code over magic.

---

# HRMS Domain Rules

Expected Modules:

- Authentication
- User Management
- Role Management
- Permission Management
- Employee Management
- Department Management
- Designation Management
- Attendance
- Leave
- Payroll
- Organization
- Notification
- Audit

New functionality must belong to an existing module or a clearly defined new module.

Do not place unrelated logic into existing modules.

---
